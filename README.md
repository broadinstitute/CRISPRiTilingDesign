# CRISPRiTilingDesign
Scripts for designing CRISPRi tiling screens.  

The major steps in the pipeline are:  
1. Choosing regions (possibly overlapping) to tile with CRISPRi gRNAs  
2. Designing all possible gRNAs in those regions.  
3. Scoring and filtering gRNAs to eliminate off-target effects and poor efficacy gRNAs.  
4. Choosing gRNAs within each region, e.g. by even selection across the region.  
5. Collating different sets of gRNAs ("subpools") into a single oligo "pool" for ordering

Also includes scripts for designing tiling prime editing screens, to factor out and move elsewhere (-Jesse)
